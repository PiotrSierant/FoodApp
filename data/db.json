      "description": "Kotlety mielone po śląsku są pysznym daniem regionalnym, które od klasycznego mięsnego rarytasu odróżnia dodatek zrumienionej cebuli i smażenie z wykorzystaniem smalcu. Te z pozoru drobne zmiany sprawiają, że danie jest pełne smaku, soczyste i niezwykle aromatyczne. Koniecznie spróbujcie — tak dobrego obiadu dawno ni jedliście.",
